                    Navbars require a wrapping .navbar with .navbar-expand for responsive collapsing and color scheme classes.
                    Navbars and their contents are fluid by default. Change the container to limit their horizontal width in different ways.
                    Use our spacing and flex utility classes for controlling spacing and alignment within navbars.
                    Navbars are responsive by default, but you can easily modify them to change that. Responsive behavior depends on our Collapse JavaScript plugin.
